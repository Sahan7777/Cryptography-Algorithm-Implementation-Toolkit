🔐 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation, testing, and performance evaluation of three fundamental cryptographic algorithms — AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), and SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm).
It was developed as part of the IE3082 – Cryptography module for the B.Sc. (Hons) in Information Technology (Cyber Security) degree program at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT).

The project aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.10 – Cryptographic Controls, focusing on maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in information systems.
